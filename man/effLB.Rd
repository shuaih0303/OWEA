\title{Lower Bound Efficiency for Crossover-Dropout Model}
\usage{
effLB(exact_design)
}
\arguments{
\item{exact_design}{A object of class  returned by design function.}
}
\value{
A list of relavent numerics.
    \item{optimal}{ Optimal Criterion}
    \item{lower.bound}{ Lower Bound of the exact design }
    \item{optimal.value}{ The value of objective function at optimal approxiamte design}
}
\description{
The function take S3 object of class 'dropout' as input and return its lower
bound of efficiency of exact design.
